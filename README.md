integration
===========

The objective of this project is to help create a reference implementation for Karaf feature containing common configuration for a few message routes implemented using Camel, Blueprint (for wiring the configuration/bundles) and ActiveMQ Broker.

Karaf runtime enhanced with Camel/Blueprint/ActiveMQ runs the routes once the developed feature is deployed.
